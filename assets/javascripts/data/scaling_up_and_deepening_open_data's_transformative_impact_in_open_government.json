Another key outcome is to highlight the role of experts from OGP Working Groups and partners as in leading sectoral open data engagement.\n", "speakers": [{"speaker": "David Lebryk", "profile": "/speaker/davidlebryk"}, {"speaker": "PM", "profile": "/speaker/paul_maltby.1vrj7lav"}, {"speaker": "Paul Maltby", "profile": "/speaker/paul_maltby.1vrj7lav"}, {"speaker": "RP", "profile": "/speaker/radu_puchiu.1vr85f1f"}, {"speaker": "Radu Puchiu", "profile": "/speaker/radu_puchiu.1vr85f1f"}, {"speaker": "Johanna Pimiento Quintero", "profile": "/speaker/johanna_pimiento_quintero.1vqt08bd"}, {"speaker": "Yeama Thompson", "profile": "/speaker/yeamathompson"}, {"speaker": "Suneeta Kaimal", "profile": "/moderator/suneetakaimal"}]}, "notes": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pRSzpD6Dhu0eOsyWT3KTSxzQd2Q5cuCTD8zQ2xDNhrU/edit?usp=sharing"}
