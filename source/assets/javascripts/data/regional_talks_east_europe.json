Disillusionment with the results of transition in the region has resulted in an overall erosion of public trust. However, open data, and in particular open government data, is being used as a transformative tool in the relationship between citizens and government. This panel will discuss to what extent have such developments taken place in the region and what are some of the other key changes that the open data agenda has brought in, as well as where does the diverse group of experts and implementers see the value in working on open data.\nHow successful have such collaborations been in countries otherwise wrought with distrust? And how can the trust generated be sustained over long periods? Are new communities created around open data, resulting in a new interaction? What incentives can spur a stronger and more ingrained movement locally?\nBy the end of the session participants will be able to:\n\n\nIdentify the latest thinking and practises of collaborative work between governments and civil society.\n\n\nGain practical insight into best practises and challenges of current initiatives.\n\n\nPresent the web-platform for data journalism in English and Russian, tailored to academic staff.\n\n\n\nUnderstand how civil society and government work together to create \u00a0innovative solutions.\n\n", "speakers": [{"profile": "/speaker/nazerke_akhmetzhanova.6s29u49", "speaker": "NA"}, {"profile": "/speaker/nazerke_akhmetzhanova.6s29u49", "speaker": "Nazerke Akhmetzhanova"}, {"profile": "/speaker/nadiyavirna", "speaker": "NB"}, {"profile": "/speaker/nadiyavirna", "speaker": "Nadiya Babynska"}, {"profile": "/speaker/georgeslabreche", "speaker": "Georges Labreche"}, {"profile": "/speaker/rulo", "speaker": "DS"}, {"profile": "/speaker/rulo", "speaker": "Du\u0161an Stojanovi\u0107"}, {"profile": "/speaker/eliraturdubaeva", "speaker": "ET"}, {"profile": "/speaker/eliraturdubaeva", "speaker": "Elira Turdubaeva"}, {"profile": "/moderator/lejlasadiku", "speaker": "Lejla Sadiku"}]}, "photos": [], "youtube": "Lguu0jGRcUw"}
