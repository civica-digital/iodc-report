Many solutions are now available either as open source, subscription (e.g., Software As a Service) or traditionally licensed products. As a result, there are many opportunities and factors for data providers, particularly government ministries, to consider in their decision making and selection criteria. This session will provide an overview of the current state of open data publishing platforms. Representatives of several leading data platforms will give \u201clightning talks\u201d on the demands and trends they\u2019re seeing and what they think might be in store for the future. There will also be a \u201ctown hall\u201d style discussion for audience members to share the challenges they are experiencing and get the views of the panel.\n", "speakers": [{"speaker": "Andrew Hoppin", "profile": "/speaker/andrewhoppin2"}, {"speaker": "Jean-Marc Lazard", "profile": "/speaker/jeanmarclazard"}, {"speaker": "Kevin Merritt", "profile": "/speaker/kevinmerritt"}, {"speaker": "Sebastian Moleski", "profile": "/speaker/sebastianmoleski"}, {"speaker": "Timothy Herzog", "profile": "/moderator/timothyherzog"}]}, "notes": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_KQoOPLLNerbH0NmM2OgSx00XYH52emK01ISwW_ZfL4/edit?usp=sharing"}
